\chapter{Prior Work}
In the previous chapter, we briefly introduced the basic ideas of Curriculum Learning and Language Modeling(LM). In this chapter, we provide a fuller treatment of these areas. In particular, in section 2.1, we describe the building blocks many language models use. Then, in section 2.2 we give a technical overview on Curriculum learning methodology focused on its implementations in Machine Translation. In section 2.3 we provide a technical overview on Language modeling focusing on how many recent systems have structured the problem and the effect various implementations have on downstream performance.  Finally, in section 2.4 we introduce a suite of evaluation frameworks which have become the de facto method to evaluate the quality of language models.
