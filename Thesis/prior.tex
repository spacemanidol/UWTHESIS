\chapter{Prior Work}
\label{chap:prior}
In the previous chapter, we briefly introduced the basic ideas of CL and LMs. In this chapter, we provide a fuller treatment of these areas. In particular, in Section \ref{chap:prior:sec:arch}, we describe the building blocks many language models use. Then, in Section \ref{chap:prior:sec:cl}, we give a technical overview of CL methodology focused on its implementations in Machine Translation. In Section \ref{chap:prior:sec:lm}, we provide a technical overview of LMs concentrating on how many current systems have structured the problem and the effect various implementations have on downstream performance.  Finally, in Section \ref{chap:prior:sec:eval}, we introduce a suite of evaluation frameworks that have become the standard for understanding the quality of LMs.
